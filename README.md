## Assignment Test Instructions
Note: Please try to run your application with the follwing commands, and check if you have expected output. This is not an official testcase, just for reference, please always follow the instructions of **[Assignment SPEC](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/static/uploads/course/COMP3331/22T2/040c4d358872ea23642cddd25ae78bbe77de773a4772d04bf0ea82612014b4c2/Assigment_22T2-version-1.0.pdf)**.

### login
 - login with correct password
 - login with incorrect password, for 3 times. -- the client terminal should shutdown and user should be blocked.
 - login with with a blocked username, from another client(new terminal).
 - login with a username that does not exist -- should print out the error
 - Check the page 16~17 in SPEC, make sure you have the same output as the examples.
 - try this new [credentials.txt](https://github.com/lrlrlrlr/COMP3331_9331_22t2/blob/main/credentials.txt)  
 
....  
{more are coming...}

### Exercise 1. 
 - Create a simulator object: `set ns [new simulator]`
 - Open file: `set fx [open filename.tr w]`
 - Create nodes: `set n1 [$ns node]`
 - Create links between the nodes: `$ns duplex-link $n1 $n6 2.5Mb 40ms DropTail`
 - Set the correct orientation: `$ns duplex-link-op $n1 $n2 orient up`
 - Setup TCP and FTP:
 	```
	# Create TCP conn
 	set tcpX [new Agent/TCP]
	$ns attach-agent $nX $tcpX

	#Sink for traffic at Node nX
	set sinkX [new Agent/TCPSink]
	$ns attach-agent $nX $sinkX

	#Connect
	$ns connect $tcpX $sinkX
	$tcpX set fid_ X

	#Setup FTP over TCP connection
	set ftpX [new Application/FTP]
	$ftpX attach-agent $tcpX
	```

- the proc function
	```
	
	proc record {} {
	>>	**global ns sink1 sink2 f1 f2**
		
		#Get an instance of the simulator
		set ns [Simulator instance]
		#Set the time after which the procedure should be called again
		set time 0.1
		#How many bytes have been received by the traffic sinks at n5?
		set bw1 [$sink1 set bytes_]
	>>	set bw2 [$sink2 set bytes_]
		#Get the current time
		set now [$ns now]
		#Calculate the bandwidth (in MBit/s) and write it to the files
		puts $f1 "$now [expr $bw1/$time*8/1000000]"
		puts $f2 "$now [expr $bw2/$time*8/1000000]"
		#Reset the bytes_ values on the traffic sinks
	>>	$sink1 set bytes_ 0
	>>	$sink2 ...........

		#Re-schedule the procedure
		$ns at [expr $now+$time] "record"
	}
	```
 - start recording: `ns at 0.0 "record"`
 - start FTP sessions: `$ns at 0.5 "$ftp1 start"`
 - Stop FTP sessions:  `$ns at 8.5 "$ftp1 stop"`
 - Call the finish procedure after 10 seconds of simulation time: `$ns at 10.0 "finish"`
 - Run the simulation: `$ns run`
